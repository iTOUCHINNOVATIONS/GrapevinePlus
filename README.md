Grapevine is a .NET 4.0 class library for embedding REST/HTTP servers **and/or** clients inside any application. This fork of Grapevine includes built in support for getting JSON from requests and responding with JSON in `RESTResource` and modifications to `Config` to serialize and deserialize the the `Config` object using JSON.
