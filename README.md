Grapevine Plus
==============

*The best solutions are the simplest to implement*. Embedding a REST/HTTP server in your application should be **simple**. Consuming REST resources from inside your application should be **simple**. If what you've been using *doesn't feel simple*, try **Grapevine**. It doesn't get any simpler than this.

>Grapevine is a .NET 4.0 class library for embedding REST/HTTP servers **and/or** clients inside any application. This fork of Grapevine includes built in support for getting JSON from requests and responding with JSON in `RESTResource` and modifications to `Config` to serialize and deserialize the the `Config` object using JSON.
